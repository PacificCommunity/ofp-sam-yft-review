**A1.a** Which fisheries, if any, should be grouped in terms of selectivity?

**A1.b** Should one longline fishery within each region have a non-decreasing
         selectivity?

**A1.c** Should selectivity be modelled using cubic splines or parametric
         curves?

**A1.d** Should selectivity be modelled as length-based, instead of age-based?

**A2.a** Should the growth curve be estimated internally in the assessment model
         or externally?

**A2.b** Should lengths from tagging data be included when fitting an external
         growth model?

**A2.c** Should the growth follow a parametric von Bertalanffy curve, a
         nonparametric curve, or in between (e.g., first 8 ages nonparametric)?

**A2.d** Should other growth curves be considered as alternatives to von
         Bertalanffy?

**A3** What is an appropriate maximum age in the YFT assessment?

**A4.a** Should the tag mixing period be 2 quarters or tag release group
         specific (as done in the SKJ 2022 assessment)?

**A4.b** Is the tagging data informative about migrations, mortality, and/or
         stock size?

**A5.a** Should the YFT assessment be 9 regions or fewer?

**A5.b** What should be the basis of region boundaries? Aspects to consider,
         including biology, fishery, management, model parsimony, model
         convergence, ease of interpretation?

**A6.a** Should fishing mortality be estimated using a catch-errors or
         catch-conditioning approach?

**A6.b** Should recruitment be estimated using an orthogonal-polynomial
         approach?

**A6.c** In addition to the Dirichlet-multinomial approach to weight length
         compositions, should the uncertainty grid include arbitrary sample size
         scalars?

**A6.d** A new alternative approach to model movement was trialled in the 2022
         SKJ assessment but the results were not considered plausible. [This is
         a placeholder for discussion].

**B1.1** Was M changed at the CondAge step in the 2020 model development?

**B1.2** Review the approach used to determine M at age and implications of
         alternative M assumptions.

**B1.3** What shape would be appropriate when estimating M at age from life
         history parameters?

**B1.4** What effect did the change in M have on depletion?

Is longline CPUE the most useful CPUE index for the YFT assessment?

Should multiple CPUE indices be considered?

CPUE CV based on data only or scaled empirically to match the standard deviation
of residuals?

CPUE process error?

Seasonal or annual CPUE?

CPUE catchability grouped or ungrouped between regions?
