# Peer review reporting process

Based on the discussions at SC18 (August 2022) - the process for reporting on
the peer review will be:

* Peer review chair provides their report to SPC (we can decide a date at the
  workshop - but perhaps a date in **early/mid-November**).

* SPC adds comments (finalise this by **end of November**).

* Peer review chair's report (with SPC comments) submitted to WCPFC Secretariat
  to be posted to an Online Discussion Forum (ODF) at **beginning of December**
  (length of forum is perhaps 3 weeks?).

* Presentation of the peer review outcomes and key recommendations to the PAW
  (Pre-assessment workshop) in late **March/early April 2023**. (If a peer
  review panel member decides to join the PAW they could present, otherwise SPC
  will present.)

* ODF comments summarised by SPC and added as an appendix to the chair's
  report - report will be submitted to SC19 in **August 2023** as a working
  paper to be presented in plenary - either by a peer review panel member
  virtually, or if a panel member can make the SC (ask commission for travel
  funding?), otherwise it can be presented by SPC.
